## Conventions

This book serves as a guide for network engineers and is crafted for network engineers to write casual code. Therefore, not much time is spent on style and beauty. Programming concepts, such as object-oriented programming, aren’t covered in detail due to their complexity. However, this book is mainly concerned with getting programs to work with the minimum amount of effort required to automate network equipment.
