## Conventions

This book is a guide for network engineers and is intended for network engineers to write code. Therefore, no time is spent on coding style. Programming concepts such as object-oriented programming are not covered in detail due to their complexity. However, this book  mainly focuses on getting  Python scripting to work with minimal effort  to automate network devices.
