# NAPALM - Unified Network Device Management

NAPALM (Network Automation and Programmability Abstraction Layer with Multivendor support) is a Python library that provides a unified interface for managing network devices from multiple vendors. It simplifies network automation tasks by abstracting the differences between vendor-specific implementations and providing a consistent set of methods for interacting with network devices. It provides a unified interface, allowing the same code to configure multi-vendor devices.

## Overview of NAPALM and Its Purpose

NAPALM aims to streamline network automation workflows by offering a unified interface for managing network devices. Its key objectives include:

- Abstracting vendor-specific complexities: NAPALM abstracts the differences between vendor-specific configurations, allowing network engineers to write automation scripts that work across different platforms.
- Simplifying network management: By providing a consistent set of methods for device configuration and management, NAPALM simplifies network automation tasks such as configuration changes, state monitoring, and data retrieval.
- Promoting interoperability: NAPALM encourages interoperability between different vendor devices, making it easier to integrate heterogeneous network environments.

### Supported Network Operating Systems

NAPALM is used to interact with various hardware networking vendors. It works as an API on top of other APIs, adding another level of abstraction. Here are some of the supported operating systems:

- Arista EOS
- Cisco IOS
- Cisco IOS-XR
- Cisco NX-OS
- Juniper JunOS

## Installation and Configuration Steps

To get started with NAPALM, you need to install the library and configure your development environment. You can install NAPALM using pip, the Python package manager:

```bash
pip install napalm
```

Once installed, you can import the NAPALM module in your Python scripts and start using its features.

### NAPALM CLI

NAPALM installation includes a CLI tool for direct usage. You can access the help menu with:

```bash
napalm --help
```

Here's an example of using NAPALM CLI to ping a device:

```bash
napalm --user admin --password cisco --vendor ios 192.168.10.10 call ping --method-kwargs "destination='192.168.10.10'"
```

### IOS Prerequisites

For IOS devices, Napalm uses the Netmiko library for interaction. Here are some prerequisites:

- Enable the archive functionality for auto-rollback.
- Enable SCP for file transfers.

See more details on the [Napalm Docs](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/ios.html)

## Working with Different Vendor Platforms using NAPALM

NAPALM supports a wide range of networking vendors, including Cisco, Juniper, Arista, and many others. It provides a consistent interface for interacting with devices from these vendors, allowing you to write automation scripts that work across multiple platforms.

Here's an example of how to connect to a Cisco router using NAPALM:

```python
import napalm

# Create a NAPALM driver for Cisco IOS
driver = napalm.get_network_driver("ios")

# Connect to the device
device = driver(hostname="172.16.10.12", username="admin", password="cisco")
device.open()

# Perform operations on the device

# Close the connection
device.close()
```

### Retrieving Device Information and Configuration Data

NAPALM provides methods for retrieving various types of information from network devices, including device details, interfaces, routing tables, and configuration data. Here's how you can retrieve the device information from a device:

```python
import napalm
import json

# Create a NAPALM driver for Cisco IOS
driver = napalm.get_network_driver("ios")

# Connect to the device
device = driver(hostname="172.16.10.12", username="admin", password="cisco")
device.open()

# Retrieve the running configuration
device_facts = device.get_facts()

# Print the running configuration
print(json.dumps(device_facts, indent=4))

# Close the connection
device.close()
```

```json
{
    "uptime": 3360.0,
    "vendor": "Cisco",
    "os_version": "3700 Software (C3725-ADVENTERPRISEK9-M), Version 12.4(15)T14, RELEASE SOFTWARE (fc2)",
    "serial_number": "FTX0945W0MY",
    "model": "3725",
    "hostname": "R1",
    "fqdn": "R1.tech.com",
    "interface_list": [
        "FastEthernet0/0",
        "FastEthernet0/1",
        "Loopback0",
        "Loopback2",
        "Loopback3",
        "Loopback4"
    ]
}
```

### Applying Configuration Changes and Managing Network State

NAPALM allows you to apply configuration changes to network devices and manage their state. You can use NAPALM to configure interfaces, modify routing tables, and perform other management tasks. Here's an example of how to configure an interface on a Cisco router:

```python
import napalm

# Configure an interface
# Create a NAPALM driver for Cisco IOS
driver = napalm.get_network_driver("ios")

# Connect to the device
device = driver(hostname="172.16.10.11", username="admin", password="cisco")
device.open()

device.load_merge_candidate(
    config="Interface GigabitEthernet0/3\ndescription Test Interface",
)
device.commit_config()

# Close the connection
device.close()
```

## Integrating NAPALM with Other Automation Tools and Frameworks

NAPALM integrates seamlessly with other automation tools and frameworks, allowing you to build comprehensive automation workflows. You can use NAPALM alongside tools like Ansible, SaltStack, and Puppet to automate network provisioning, configuration management, and monitoring tasks.

## Configuration support Method

NAPALM offers various methods for configuration support, such as replace, merge, commit confirm, compare config, atomic changes, and rollback. You can find more details in the [official docs](https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base.html).
